# A Pokedex for Gen 1 Pokemon

Project was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It utilizes data from a Pokemon API to fetch information and display various attributes and then shows an image of various Pokemon.

This was my first project in CareerFoundryâ€™s Full Stack Web Development program.

Here is the API that was used to load information for the Pokemon:https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150
